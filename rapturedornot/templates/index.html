        <p>You do know the Rapture is on its way, right? May 21, 6 PM local time? It's true. You know how I know?</p>
        <h1>Numbers.</h1>
        <p>Yeah numbers. Here's my proof:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>5 is atonement, 10 is completeness, and 17 is heaven. These numbers were chosen by fair die roll.</li>
            <li>Jesus died the first time on April 1, 33 A.D. Add 1,978 years to this date and you get April 1, 2011. On April 1, 2011 I was reading a brilliant treatise on methods for using the patterns on the shells of tortoises to predict the outcomes of Formula 1 races when I spilled my coffee. It left a stain in the shape of a circle, the perfect shape, and so I determined that this date is significant.</li>
            <li>Multiply 1,978 by the number of days in the solar year, 365.2422, and you get 722,449. I'm a little fuzzy on this step actually.</li>
            <li>May 21 is 51 days after April 1. 722,449 + 51 is 722,500. And why does this matter?</li>
            <li>BECAUSE (ATONEMENT X COMPLETION X HEAVEN) SQUARED IS (5 X 10 X 17)^2 = 722,500! BOOM!</li>
        </ol>
